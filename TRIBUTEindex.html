            <p>Shaheed Bhagat Singh was a revolutionary freedom fighter who played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence. Born on September 28, 1907, in Punjab, Bhagat Singh was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and joined the freedom movement at a young age.</p>
            <p>He is remembered for his courage, patriotism, and sacrifice. Bhagat Singh, along with his comrades, Sukhdev and Rajguru, was involved in the assassination of British police officer John Saunders, for which he was hanged on March 23, 1931, at the age of 23.</p>
            <p>His legacy continues to inspire generations of Indians to fight against injustice and oppression. Bhagat Singh remains an icon of bravery and martyrdom in the history of India's struggle for freedom.</p>
